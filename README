Question 1:

run the program by typing "./ttt 123456789"

- the alien will be first to play
- if it will print "I win", the alien won.
- if it will print "I lose", the human won.



Question 2:

run the program by typing "./mync -e "./ttt 123456789""

- the program will excute the ttt program and play the game with the alien.



Question 3:

a few options to run the program - 
1. run the program by typing "./mync -e "./ttt 123456789" -i TCPS4050" - this will run the program and get the input from port 4050.
2. run the program by typing "./mync -e "./ttt 123456789" -o TCPS4050" - this will run the program and send the output to port 4050.
3. run the program by typing "./mync -e "./ttt 123456789" -b TCPS4050" - this will run the program and get the input and send the output on port 4050.
4. run the program by typing "./mync -e "./ttt 123456789" -i TCPS4050 -o TCPC4455" - this will run the program and get the input from port 4050 and send the output to port 4455.
  - remember to run the server 4455 before running the program with option 4 "nc -l -p 4455" (terminal 1).
  - after running the server, run the program with option 4 "./mync -e "./ttt 123456789" -i TCPS4050 -o TCPC4455" (terminal 2).
  - on another terminal (terminal 3) run the client "nc localhost 4050" to see the output.

Question 3.5:

- if there is no "-e "./ttt 123456789"" in the command, the program will act as a simple netcat program.


Question 4:

*** the program is not working as expected. ***
# need to continue working on 3.5
# 3.5 should work as a regular netcat program
# the problem we have is the close at the end of the tcp server
# need to create some kind of flag/msg to tell when to close the connection




*** fix ***
# need to fix the close at the end of the tcp server
# need to create some kind of flag/msg to tell when to close the connection
